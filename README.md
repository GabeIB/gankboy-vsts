VSTs I'm writing with the JUCE framework

Important to note here that I'm building these VSTs with JUCE 5.3.2 so that it builds VST3s that are compatible with VST2. This is because I still use Ableton 9 for music production. Feel free to send me money to buy Ableton 10 if you want me to change this.
